                <p>Growing up in a small Turkish village, Edu Care founder Eren Bali had few educational opportunities â€” until he got a computer. Fueled by his dream to compete in mathematics, he used the internet to learn his way to a silver medal in the International Math Olympiad.</p>
                <p>After learning online changed his life, Eren partnered with co-founders Oktay Caglar and Gagan Biyani to achieve a common goal: to make quality education accessible to all.</p>
